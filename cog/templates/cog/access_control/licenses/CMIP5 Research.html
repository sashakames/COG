<em class="bold">CMIP5 terms of use for data limited to non-commercial research and educational purposes</em>

<br/>&nbsp;<p/>
[N.B.  If you plan to use your data for anything other than non-commercial research and
educational purposes, you should register for the "CMIP5 commercial" group, not this
group.]

<p/>
a) I agree to restrict my use of CMIP5 model output FOR NON-COMMERCIAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  For research to be considered non-commercial, its end products (in the form of data sets, reports, and other publications) must not be considered proprietary, and they must be made generally available through open publication or by equally accessible means. Materials prepared for educational purposes cannot be sold.  These restrictions may only be relaxed by permission of the individual modeling groups responsible for the simulations.

<p/>
b) I will hold no individual(s), organization(s), or group(s) responsible for any errors in
the models or in their output data.

<p/>
c) In publications that rely on the CMIP5 model output, I will appropriately credit the
data providers by an acknowledgment similar to the following:

"For their roles in producing, coordinating, and making available the CMIP5 model
output, we acknowledge the climate modeling groups (listed in Table XX of this
paper), the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP) Working Group on
Coupled Modelling (WGCM), and the Global Organization for Earth System Science
Portals (GO-ESSP)."

whereâ€œTable XX" in your paper should list the models and modelling groups
that provided the data you have used.

<p/>
d) I understand that Digital Object Identifiers (DOI's used, for example, in journal
citations) will be assigned to various subsets of the CMIP5 multi-model dataset,
and when available and as appropriate, I will cite these references in my
publications.  I will consult the CMIP5 website (http://cmip-esgf-node.llnl.gov/cmip5/) to learn how to do this.

<p/>
e) I acknowledge the potential limitations of the data obtained from this archive.
These may include (but are not necessarily limited to) errors in the models,
shortcomings in the experiment designs, the conjectural quality of the forcing
scenarios used to drive the models, and so on.

<p/>
f) I understand that although the model output has been subjected to a quality control
procedure, unrecognized errors almost certainly remain.

<p/>
g) To aid participating groups in understanding and improving upon their models'
behaviors, I will respond to reasonable requests from the WGCM for feedback about
my CMIP5 research results (e.g., reporting model deficiencies, recording CMIP5
publications, etc.).
